# Microservice Product Catalog

This project was developed to provide an example of how microservices architecture can be used. My aim is to help others learn more about this architecture.

I hope that this project can be useful for anyone who is interested in building microservices-based applications.

I faced a challenge while configuring Elastic with Spring Boot. To tackle this, I used the following versions:

*1.spring-data-elasticsearch = 4.3.3 *   
*2.elasticsearch-rest-high-level-client = 7.15.2*    
*2.elasticsearch = 7.14.0*    
*3.Java = 17*  
*4.Spring Boot = 3.0.6*   

It was a difficult task as most of the versions threw errors.
